=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Repository Pulse Dashboard - Phase 2 Metrics Calculation Engine
Spec: 003-implement-phase-2-repository-pulse-dashboard
Started: December 30, 2025

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: New feature implementation adding 7 metric calculators to enable trend analysis.
           Follows established patterns from HealthScore.js with comprehensive unit testing.

================================================================================
Session 1 (Planner):
================================================================================

- Completed codebase investigation
- Identified patterns from HealthScore.js and RepositoryDNA/
- Created implementation_plan.json with 8 phases, 15 subtasks
- Created init.sh for environment setup
- Updated context.json with findings

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 1 subtask - Create directory and constants.js
- Phase 2 (Utilities): 1 subtask - Create utility functions
- Phase 3 (Core Calculators): 3 subtasks - Velocity, Momentum, Issue Temperature
- Phase 4 (Advanced Calculators): 3 subtasks - PR Health, Bus Factor, Freshness
- Phase 5 (Aggregator): 2 subtasks - Overall Pulse, calculateAllMetrics wrapper
- Phase 6 (Exports): 1 subtask - Create index.js with public API
- Phase 7 (Testing): 5 subtasks - Comprehensive unit tests
- Phase 8 (Verification): 2 subtasks - Full test suite, integration check

Services Involved:
- main: Single-page vanilla JavaScript application (Vite + Vitest)

Files to Create:
- src/js/components/PulseDashboard/constants.js
- src/js/components/PulseDashboard/PulseCalculator.js
- src/js/components/PulseDashboard/index.js
- src/js/__tests__/PulseDashboard.test.js

Reference Files:
- src/js/components/HealthScore.js (calculation pattern)
- src/js/__tests__/HealthScore.test.js (test pattern)
- src/js/components/RepositoryDNA/index.js (export pattern)
- docs/repository-pulse-dashboard-implementation-plan.md (specifications)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2 (Phase 3 and 4 can run together)
- Recommended workers: 1 (sequential is safer for this task)
- Potential speedup: 1.2x if parallelized

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: medium
- Test types: unit tests
- Target coverage: 90%+
- Existing tests: 283 (must not regress)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/ambrealismwork/Desktop/Coding-Projects/github-repo-explorer
  npm install
  npm test  # Verify existing tests pass

Then proceed with implementation following implementation_plan.json
